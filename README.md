# CSVConverter
This is CSV converter, it can convert to JSON, HTML, and XML formats.
It's mainly written in JavaScript using Node.js but has some Python as an additional program for .csv to .json.
It has almost no UI so you have to enter the commands by the console.

I'm currently working on upgrades, I'll update this file with the instructions on how to use it.

All this code is free to use (MIT license), happy coding!
